## 📱 Project Summary

Tajammal is a mobile application that connects clients with service providers in the event planning industry. It offers users an easy way to browse, explore, and book a variety of event-related services such as venues, catering, decoration, photography, transportation, and more — all in one place.

## 🧠 Problem Solving

Planning an event often involves coordinating with multiple vendors, comparing prices, availability, and quality — a process that is time-consuming and stressful. There is no single reliable platform that offers clear reviews, booking, and direct communication. Tajammal solves this by providing an easy-to-use app that connects clients with trusted event service providers, simplifying the booking and planning process.
